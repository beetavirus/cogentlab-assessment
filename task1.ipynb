      "In the remote Russian fortress, former university student Rodion Raskolnikov is serving an eight-year sentence. His past altruistic deeds haunt him, as does his mother, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who is deeply grieved by her daughter's marriage and Raskolnikov's disturbed mental state. Raskolnikov's suffering is exacerbated by his mother's illness, vivid nightmares, and his unending obsession with Svidrigaïlov, a menacing figure from his past. He finds solace in deep introspection with Sonia, the daughter of the late Mr. Marmeladov who was tragically killed before Raskolnikov's eyes. The narrative becomes more complex with the sudden appearance of Pyotr Petrovitch, a potential suitor, who brings news of an unexpected inheritance for Dounia, further complicating the family dynamics. Despite the strained relationships and emotional turmoil, Raskolnikov announces his separation from his family, stating that only Sonia is his family now. This leads to the intense climax of Crime and Punishment. Additionally, Raskolnikov experiences disdain and hatred from his fellow prisoners who view his crime as contemptible. His religious beliefs, or lack thereof, become a point of contention leading to threats on his life. Amidst this chaos, a touching scene illustrating the loyalty of Raskolnikov's friend Razumihin, despite his excessive drinking and eccentric behavior, is portrayed. This tale of struggle, introspection, and redemption, penned by Dostoevsky, a once-unknown writer who faced his own trials and tribulations, continues to resonate today. The story also gives a glimpse into the lifestyle and fashion of the time, showcasing the influence of foreign trends on the society, which adds another layer to the vivid depiction of the setting and characters.\n",
